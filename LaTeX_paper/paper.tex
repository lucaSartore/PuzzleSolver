\section{Abstract}
The jigsaw puzzle problem has been in the eye of computer scientists for a while,
and some clever solutions have already been found. These algorithms are made to
work with a “digital” jigsaw puzzle~\ref{fig:figure_digital_puzzle},
but there aren't papers (at least not popular enough to be searchable)
that try to apply the solution
to a “real world” jigsaw puzzle~\ref{fig:figure_real_puzzle}.\newline
The problem has been tackled by some small projects. But, as said earlier,
the process and eventual challenges has never been documented by a full paper,
this wants to be the first.\newline
As a bonus the paper will also cover the creation of a user friendly app
that will be open source and free to use.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Classification}
This paper will focus on type 2 puzzles. A type 2 puzzle is a puzzle where the position, and the orientation of each piece is unknown. 
\subsection{Digital vs Real-World Jigsaw Puzzles}

There is  another important distinction between different types of puzzles. They can be divided into “digital” and “real world” jigsaw puzzles.

The reason this distinction is important is because,
despite the generic concept of the puzzle not changing,
obtaining accurate matches of a piece's characteristics
is far easier with a digital puzzle,
since there are far less things that can go wrong.

\section{Previous Literature}
This section will analyze 3 different algorithms that have been proposed
as a solution of type 2 puzzles. The objective is to understand the
strengths and the weaknesses of each one, to build up some knowledge
that will be useful for the next section.

\subsection{General Structure Of The Algorithms}

All the algorithms that will be analyzed are composed of 3 sub algorithms:


\begin{indented_section}

    \subsubsection{The Splitter:} This component takes as input one or more images
    containing all the pieces. It then split all the pieces from each other,
    9and split each piece into his four sides.\label{document:splitter}

    \subsubsection{The Comparator:} This component compares each side with all the
    others, in order to understand whether they match or not.\newline
    There are two distinct kinds of “Comparator” algorithms:
    The “Binary Comparison” and the “Non Binary Comparison”.
    As the name suggests when comparing two sides with a “Binary Comparison”
    the result can either be 0 (they do not match) or 1 (they match).
    In contrast a “Non Binary Comparison” can give any value between 0 and 1.
    This allows states of uncertainty to be represented.\label{document:comparator}

    \subsubsection{The Solver:} This component  uses the information provided by the
    Comparator~\ref{document:comparator}, and tries to find a solution
    (i.e.\ a position and an orientation for each piece)
    that is the most likely to be correct.\label{document:solver}
