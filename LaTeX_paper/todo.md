# Todo List
 - dividere sezione 3 in 2 parti, la seconda va alla fine nei related work

 - la sezione 6 va messa nei related work

 - la seziuone 5 e 7 vanno mergiate

# New structure

 - Abstract
 - Introduction
   - Context
     - Classification
     - Digital vs Real
     - Structure of the algorithms
    - Problem (The objective of this paper)
    - Setup (The Puzzle To Solve)
  - Our solution
    - Comparator
    - Solver
  - Related work
    - 3 papers
    - Why not to use their comparator?
  - Testing result
  - Future work
    - Labeling tool
    - Machine learning based comparator

# Note MP
no references in the abstract

references are strange, use Cleveref
F1 / F2 are figs, but 3.1.2 ?

eliminate all passive voice

abstract is not a section

use template from the thesis for the introduction

move section 3 to end as RW ? perhaps here not needed

Section 4 is part of the introduction

section 5 -> change title to experimental setup
this needs an intro guiding paragraph

figure 4: reduce subfigs to fit in 1 page ?

section 6: needs better title, i need to understand the content

6.1 -> proof ? unlikely the right term

page 12: table without reference nor caption

figure 6: missing connection to text ?
also, the inner text must go
what's the Y axis label?

section 8.2 is a bit small ...

i don't understand section 9

in general, i don't understand the logic behind sections 5-6-7-8-9
i find it strange that you need 5 sections for the main core of the paper so we'll have to find a more logical restructuring.
a background or overview section will likely contain some parts of these sections, like the setup, input data, solver overview, testing setup ...
so, 5 goes away, this leaves, 6 and 7 to be merged, 9 can go as future work in a subsection of conclusion, effectively having
intro
RW
Overview
6+7
